## üí° About  
CloudS2Mask is an open-source Python library that efficiently segments clouds and cloud shadows in Sentinel-2 imagery using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Benchmarks with the CloudSEN12 Dataset show a 17% error reduction compared to the most competent existing methods.

## üéØ Features  
* High-precision cloud and cloud shadow segmentation for Sentinel-2 L1C imagery.
* Rapid processing: Approximately 2.2 seconds per scene at 20m resolution (RTX 4090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X).
* Compatibility with both GPU and non-GPU systems.
* Supported on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## üöÄ Installation  
**Windows Users with NVIDIA GPUs**: Before installing CloudS2Mask, ensure you've installed [PyTorch with CUDA support](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then follow the steps below.

**Mac and Linux Users**: You can proceed with the installation commands below.
To install CloudS2Mask, clone this repository and proceed with manual installation.
```console
git clone https://github.com/DPIRD-DMA/CloudS2Mask
cd CloudS2Mask
pip install -q .
cd ..
```

## üíª Usage  
Here's a simple demonstration of how to use CloudS2Mask:

All you need to do is pass a list of Sentinel-2 level 1C 'SAFE' directories to CloudS2Mask.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from clouds2mask import (
    create_settings,
    batch_process_scenes,
)

output_dir = Path("./outputs")
l1c_folders_path = Path("/path/to/your/S2_l1c_SAFE/folders")
l1c_folders = list(l1c_folders_path.glob("*.SAFE"))


scene_settings = create_settings(
    sent_safe_dirs=l1c_folders,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    processing_res=20,
)

paths_to_masks = batch_process_scenes(scene_settings)
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Tuning
CloudsS2Mask offers a range of performance and accuracy options, here are some examples,

Settings for high accuracy inference:

```python
scene_settings = create_settings(
    sent_safe_dirs=l1c_folders,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    batch_size=32,
    tta_max_depth=5,
    processing_res=10,
    patch_overlap_px=64,
    model_ensembling=True,
)
```
Settings for fast inference:
```python
scene_settings = create_settings(
    sent_safe_dirs=l1c_folders,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    batch_size=32,
    processing_res=20,
    output_compression=None,
)
```
Settings for CPU inference:
```python
scene_settings = create_settings(
    sent_safe_dirs=l1c_folders,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    batch_size=1,
    processing_res=20,
)
```
CloudS2Mask will try to auto detect acceleration cards such as NVIDIA GPUs or Apple MPS, but you can also manually specify them like this:
```python
scene_settings = create_settings(
    sent_safe_dirs=l1c_folders,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    pytorch_device='MPS',
)
```
